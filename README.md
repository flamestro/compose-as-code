# compose-as-code
This project aims to provide a way of expressing and generating docker compose as code.

The vision is that certain docker compose setups can easily be shared via modules in the future instead of copying and pasting.

Right now it is not really far. However, it can already create basic docker compose files and reusable minimal services.
